        "gross_profit": "Gross profit is important to investors because it is a key driver of a company's net income or profitability. With a high gross profit margin, a company generates more revenue from each unit of product or service sold, resulting in a higher net income and higher stock price.

        "return_on_equity": "Investors use ROE to evaluate a company's financial performance over time and to compare it with other companies in the same field.

        "equity_ratio": "Investors should pay attention to the equity ratio because it shows how much of a company's assets are financed by equity as opposed to debt.

A lower EV/EBITDA or EV/Sales ratio, in general, may show that a company is undervalued or has better growth prospects than its competitors.
