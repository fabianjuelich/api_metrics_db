# Practical project in WS 23/24: Infrastructure for economic fundamentals

Supervisor: __Prof. Dr. Johann Schaible__\
Elaboration by: __Fabian Jülich and Denis Kalacevic__

### This project follows on from the previous one, where we implemented the idea of ​​publishing the 12 most important indexes for evaluating stocks by handing over a ticker. Now we plan to store this data over a longer period of time in order to be able to analyze changes and associated opportunities.

Building on __[Procurement & Analysis of stock key figures](./WI-Projekt_SS23_Juelich_Kalacevic/)__
