## Quality of the Support:

To test the response time and quality of support, a test email was composed and sent to the four providers. FMP and Leeway provided a reasonable and satisfactory response. There was no response from Alpha Vantage.


### Email for Support Test:

Subject: API Support Responsiveness

Dear …,

We are currently evaluating various Finance/Stock API providers for a project I am working on. As part of this evaluation, I wanted to test the responsiveness of your support team.

Could you please confirm the receipt of this email by replying to it? This will help me determine the efficiency of your support system and give me confidence in considering your API services for integration.

Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Denis


## Is Backtesting possible?

The time period for backtesting with a financial APIs depends on the specific trading or investment strategy and the data you need for the analysis. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to how far back the historical data should go, as it can vary based on factors such as your trading frequency, asset class, and the nature of your strategy.

In this case the answer is still easy because if you wanted to backtest with the 12 Stock key figures we calculated in the last Project, it would not be possible to calculate for example, the Price to Earning with Alpha Vantage, because they only provide the current EPS in the Company Overview. Also the fundamentaldata only goes back to 2018.

FMP provides 15+ years of Financial Statements, including international filings.

Leeway provides fundamental data back up to 30 years and the historical prices of up to 100 years.

## How often is the fundamental data updated?

To get an reliable answer to that, we asked the API providers themselves.

FMP stated that their Financial Statement endpoint is updated after a few minutes/hours after published on SEC for US companies and the International Filings is updated daily.

Leeway stated that the data is updated daily but there might be a slight delay after the release of earningsreports. This also depends on the size of the company, how fast they publish and the market, but usually happens within a few days.

Alpha Vantage didn’t respond, but on their Website it says that the Data is generally refreshed on the same day a company reports its latest earnings and financials.

## How good is the API Documentation?

FMP has the best API documentation. They provide a wide range of various financial-related data. Everything is categorized into their respective areas, and there is always a detailed explanation. There is also a page with individual formulas for different ratios, which is very helpful. There are also language specific guides. One thing that is very usefull that only FMP provides, is that it lists the properties of the Financial Reports i.e. the properties of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow, so that you don't have to call the API first and then look if the specific value you need is listed.

Alpha Vantage is in second place. They also provide everything categorized into their respective areas, with descriptions and examples for the various parameters that can be used. However, it offers a significantly narrower range compared to FMP. Additionally, there are no formulas that explain how the ratios are composed or calculated. Alpha Vantage also offers language-specific guides for the API. Unlike FMP, there is also no upfront overview of what is listed in the respective documents, so you have to make the API call first.

Leeway has by far the worst API documentation in terms of design. Leeway uses URL endpoint resources in their documentation, which can make it relatively unclear what exactly one is searching for. Everything is categorized into its respective area, similar to other APIs, but this presentation style can be less user-friendly and somewhat challenging to navigate when working with the API for the first time. There is a brief description for each endpoint, which is well done. One notable feature is that in the case of fundamentals, you can pass the exchange directly in the request. However, there are neither formulas nor an upfront overview of what is listed in the fundamentals.

## Are there access limitations in the free version/ Is there a premium version?

Each of the three API providers has premium versions of their API, along with limitations in the free version.

For Financial Modeling Prep, there are four different versions available:

1. Free: Provides access only to the US market, allows 250 requests per day, no access to premium endpoints, a maximum limit of 5 for all endpoints, and access to only annual data.
2. Starter for $14/month: Offers 100% market coverage, allows 300 API requests per minute, provides 30 years of historical data, and can be canceled at any time.
3. Professional for $39/month: Also provides 100% market coverage, allows 750 API requests per minute, grants access to premium endpoints, offers 30 years of historical data, includes chat and email priority support, bulk download endpoints, WebSocket, and can be canceled at any time.
4. Enterprise for $75/month: Offers 100% market coverage, access to premium endpoints, 30 years of historical data, is allowed for commercial use (unlike the others), includes chat and email priority support, a 99.95% uptime SLA, bulk endpoints, stock ownership endpoints, WebSocket, and can also be canceled at any time.

For Leeway there are 2 different versions available:

A Free and a Premium version for 69,95€/month, but the only difference here is the number of requests available.

The Free Plan offers only 50 requests per day, while the Premium version provides 100,000 requests per day. Both versions offer access to over 40 global exchanges, 25,000+ global stocks, and historical data of up to 20 years for fundamental data. For End-of-Day data, it's the same, except for historical data where the complete history is provided.

For Alpha Vantage there are 3 different versions available:

There is a Free version that covers the majority of the datasets for up to 5 API requests per minute and 100 requestes per day.

An Acadameic version called “Academic Access”.

And a Premium version with several different payment plans:

- 30 API requests per minute + 15-minute delayed US market data for $24,99/month
- 75 API requests per minute + 15-minute delayed US market data: $49,99/month
- 150 API requests per minute + realtime US market data: $99,99/month
- 300 API requests per minute + realtime US market data: $149,99/month
- 600 API requests per minute + realtime US market data: $199,99/month
- 1200 API requests per minute + realtime US market data: $249,99/month

## Important to know:
